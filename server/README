Installation
==================================================================================


To install ``iplwcl-server``,  update the paths and user and group in
the ``configuration.lisp`` file, and the ``Makefile`` (or leave the defaults).

1. Create a user and group for iplwcl: ::

       groupadd iplwcl
       useradd -g iplwcl -m iplwcl


2. Install ccl and quicklisp

3. Compile and install the iplwcl server: ::

       make iplwcl-server
       sudo make install

4. Launch the server: ::

       sudo ./siab

The server can also be launched eg. from /etc/rc.local; cf. the ``siab``
script for an example of the command line.


Architecture
========================================================================

We use *shellinaboxd* as a terminal emulator in a web page.
Notice: we need the patch ``0001-add-new-keyCodes-used-by-FF15.patch``
to be able to type dashes in *firefox*!

The ``siab`` script runs *shellinaboxd* in background, as *root*.  It is
started from ``/etc/rc.local``.

This script configures a single services on the ``/`` path, to run the
``iplwcl-server`` as *root*. 

``iplwcl-server`` is a *ccl* program that manages users.  It lets them
create account, and log in.  When a user logs in the first time, it
creates a chroot jail box for her to run *ccl* in a private environment.


Directories and files
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/usr/local/share/ipl/scripts/make-chroot

    This script builds the chroot jail for a user.


/usr/local/share/ipl/scripts/run

    This script enters the chroot jail, switching to the iplwcl unix
    user account.

/usr/local/share/ipl/scripts/siab

    This script runs the shellinaboxd server.

/usr/local/share/ipl/bin/iplwcl-server

    This program manages the users and chroot jail boxes.

/usr/local/share/ipl/etc/users.data

    This is the user database.

/usr/local/share/ipl/users/
    
    This directory contains the user's chroot jail boxes.  Each user
    is identified by a md5 hash of their login and token, and their
    chroot jail box is stored in a directory named such as: ::

       /usr/local/share/ipl/users/E64/E64F075DB706AE4BFA5C848C24D04B8C/


Chroot Jail
==================================================================================

Note: the setup of the chroot jail is done by the make-chroot script.
Some level of automatism is included in it, but it could be more
parameterized (eg. we could give it a configuration file or parameters
to tell it what implementation and executables to include).  While it
tries to find automatically the libraries depended on by the
implementation and programs, it doesn't seem to be doing a very good
job for gethostbyname in all cases.  Eg. it works on GNU/Linux debian
6.0.9 but not on GNU/Linux debian 7.4 wheezy.
